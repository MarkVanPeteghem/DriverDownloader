Selecting models
----------------
To select the models for which you want to download all drivers,
select the manufacturer and category, select one or more models
and click 'Add selected models'. The application will ask to select
a directory for each model.
To restrict the number of models that are shown, type part of
the model name in the text box to the right. Spaces are ignored,
and matching is case insensitive.

Downloading
-----------
To download the drivers for the selected models, click 'Download'.
While a file is downloading it will have the extension 'incomplete'.
If the download is successful, this extension is removed.
If an error occurs during the download, this extension is kept.
If the download for a model is repeated and the same directory is selected,
files that were downloaded successfully before will not be downloaded again,
while files that were not successfully downloaded (with extension 'incomplete')
will be removed and downloaded again.
Downloads that had an error will show this in their status. If all the
downloads are finished, and 'Download' is clicked again, the models that
had download errors will be downloaded again. Other files will also
be downloaded again.
Note: while downloading you can still select other models. They will also
be downloaded.

Exception list
--------------
In the file ExceptionList.txt you can specify names of files that should
not be downloaded. Enter one filename per line (not the complete link,
only the filename), empty lines are ignored.

Updating model numbers
----------------------
If you cannot find a model number in the list, it may be that the list is not
uptodate. In that case click the 'Update data...' button.
Note however that this can take a long time, especially for HP and Lenovo.
